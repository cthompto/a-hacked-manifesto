      Adouble spooks the world, the double of abstraction. The fortunes of
      states and armies, companies and communities depend on it. All contending
      classes, be they ruling or ruled, revere it—yet fear it. Ours is a world
      that ventures blindly into the new with its fingers crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All classes fear this relentless abstraction of the world, on which their
      fortunes yet depend. All classes but one: the hacker class. We are the
      hackers of abstraction. We produce new concepts, new perceptions, new
      sensations, hacked out of raw data. Whatever code we hack, be it
      programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves or colorings,
      we are the abstracters of new worlds. Whether we come to represent
      ourselves as researchers or authors, artists or biologists, chemists or
      musicians, philosophers or programmers, each of these subjectivities is
      but a fragment of a class still becoming, bit by bit, aware of itself as
      such.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet we don’t quite know who we are. That is why this book seeks to
      make manifest our origins, our purpose and our interests. A hacker
      manifesto: Not the only manifesto, as it is in the nature of the hacker to
      differ from others, to differ even from oneself, over time. To hack is to
      differ. A hacker manifesto cannot claim to represent what refuses
      representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hackers create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not
      always great things, or even good things, but new things. In art, in
      science, in philosophy and culture, in any production of knowledge where
      data can be gathered, where information can be extracted from it, and
      where in that information new possibilities for the world produced, there
      are hackers hacking the new out of the old. While we create these new
      worlds, we do not possess them. That which we create is mortgaged to
      others, and to the interests of others, to states and corporations who
      monopolize the means for making worlds we alone discover.We do not own
      what we produce—it owns us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hackers use their knowledge and their wits to maintain their autonomy.
      Some take the money and run. (We must live with our compromises.) Some
      refuse to compromise. (We live as best we can.) All too often those of us
      who take one of these paths resent those who take the other. One lot
      resents the prosperity it lacks, the other resents the liberty it lacks to
      hack away at the world freely. What eludes the hacker class is a more
      abstract expression of our interests as a class, and of how this interest
      may meet those of others in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hackers are not joiners. We’re not often willing to submerge our
      singularity. What the times call for is a collective hack that realizes a
      class interest based on an alignment of differences rather than a coercive
      unity. Hackers are a class, but an abstract class. A class that makes
      abstractions, and a class made abstract. To abstract hackers as a class is
      to abstract the very concept of class itself. The slogan of the hacker
      class is not the workers of the world united, but the workings of the
      world untied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everywhere abstraction reigns, abstraction made concrete. Everywhere
      abstraction’s straight lines and pure curves order matters along complex
      but efficient vectors. But where education teaches what one may produce
      with an abstraction, the knowledge most useful for the hacker class is of
      how abstractions are themselves produced. Deleuze: “Abstractions explain
      nothing, they themselves have to be explained.”*
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstraction may be discovered or produced, may be material or immaterial,
      but abstraction is what every hack produces and affirms. To abstract is to
      construct a plane upon which otherwise different and unrelated matters may
      be brought into many possible relations. To abstract is to express the
      virtuality of nature, to make known some instance of its possibilities, to
      actualize a relation out of infinite relationality, to manifest the
      manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
      History is the production of abstraction and the abstraction of
      production. What makes life differ in one age after the next is the
      application of new modes of abstraction to the task of wresting freedom
      from necessity. History is the virtual made actual, one hack after
      another. History is the cumulative qualitative differentiation of nature
      as it is hacked.
