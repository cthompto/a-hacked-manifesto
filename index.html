        <i>A Hacked Manifesto</i> is an artwork in the form of an online tool
        for exploring the McKenzie Wark's <i>A Hacker Manifesto</i> giving the
        user/viewer the ability to manipulate, disassemble, reassemble, shift,
        search and other modify the text. This net art piece engages directly
        with hacking as a gesture as defined within the source text:
      </p>

      <p class="quote">
        “To hack is to abstract. To abstract is to produce the plane upon which
        different things may enter into relation.” [083]
      </p>

      <p>
        This work brings the text itself into a plane upon which new relations
        can form. The experience of this work will be a web interface where
        users/viewers will have access to a variety of tools for reordering,
        searching, selecting, replacing, and other textual gestures. This work
        is not about using tools that could be understood as generative AI but
        rather is focused on computation as a tool for textual collage and
        exploration.
